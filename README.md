## ü©∫ Healthcare Chatbot

An interactive healthcare chatbot developed using **Python**, combining **natural language processing (NLP)**, **machine learning**, and **speech recognition**. The chatbot assists users in receiving basic healthcare guidance and helps in selecting appropriate healthcare professionals.

### ‚ú® Features

- **Text-based Interaction**: Users can type their queries and receive AI-generated responses based on a trained model.
- **Voice Input**: Users can speak their queries using a microphone. Voice is converted to text using Google's Speech Recognition API.
- **Doctor Selection**: Recommends specific types of doctors (e.g., Pediatricians, Psychiatrists) based on user input.
- **Pre-trained Model**: Utilizes a deep learning model trained on labeled healthcare conversations.
- **User Interface (GUI)**: Built with `tkinter`, providing a simple and intuitive interface for text and voice interaction.

### üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- Python 3
- `NLTK` for Natural Language Processing
- `Keras` / `TensorFlow` for the machine learning model
- `SpeechRecognition` and `pyaudio` for voice input
- `tkinter` for GUI development

## üå¶Ô∏è Automated Weather Alert System

A real-time weather monitoring and alert application developed in **C++**. This system fetches current weather data, analyzes conditions, and sends customized alerts to users based on temperature or severe weather events.

### ‚ú® Features

- **Real-time Weather Data**: Uses `cURL` to fetch data from a weather API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap).
- **JSON Parsing**: Uses `jsoncpp` to parse weather information.
- **Smart Advisories**: Suggests actions such as staying hydrated in hot weather or wearing jackets in the cold.
- **Email Notifications**: Sends email alerts to students or admins via an integrated mailer function.
- **Admin Control**: Admins can trigger notifications with a single click.

### üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- C++ (Standard Library)
- `cURL` for making API calls
- `jsoncpp` for handling JSON responses
- Email functionality (e.g., via SMTP or system command integration)
